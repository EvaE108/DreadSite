    <p> Well, well, well, it seems you have stumbled upon tiny corner of the internet <br>
        This site was created for those who love the thrill of the unknown. For those seeking something <br>
        hidden between the lines of this dull world. <br>
        But do not be fooled by my cordial manner, this website was not simply meant to be a brainteaser, it was meant to be truly scary <br>
        But what makes something truly scary? <br>
        Well, a true student of fright knows that the scariest things are the ones that blur the line between reality and fiction. <br>
        They are the things that, if even only for a moment, you ask yourself, is this real? <br>
        Once you begin this journey of fear and fun, just know there will be NO help along the way <br> 
        And always remember I Ctrl U <br>
        Good Luck. You are going to need it
